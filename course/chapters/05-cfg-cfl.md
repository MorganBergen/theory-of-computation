# context free grammars and languages

one application for context free grammars in parse trees is to descrive the syntax of programming languages, that answers the following question

> given a string of characters, is it a valid program?

> what are the legal programs that you can write in that programming language?

the grammar can be used to automatically generate the part of the compiler for that programming language which will interpret the structure of the input, which is the so called parser.  the parser will figure out the meaning of the input to the compiler so that the compiler can then interpret the code or interpret the resulting code that you have given it.

and the meaning is embedded within the structure of the parse tree
